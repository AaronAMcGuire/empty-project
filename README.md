# Empty project
---
:bangbang: Although this project is fully functional there are still aspects that need to be implemented e.g. auto destination changes when building dist :bangbang:
---
This project was setup as a place to pull an empty working directory from when developing. There is a change in this build compared to the Blank-Project repo - this empty project uses pug as the main way to develop and because of this the project uses different grunt tasks.

## Current Tasks in the gruntfiles.js:

1. browserSync
2. CssComb
3. CssMin
4. HtmlMin
5. Pug
6. Sass
7. Sass Globbing
8. Watch

### Custom tasks:
1. Dist
2. Optimise
3. Watch
4. Default

for best results use the project with Atom and Bottom-dock grunt plugin installed ( or use terminal..:neckbeard: )
